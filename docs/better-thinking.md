[Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/) popularized the concept of Focused and Diffused thinking. Being both equally important. The former is when we get into a state of deep focus and, the latter when we allow our minds to wander free.

Ways of going into diffused modes of thinking could be taking a walk, doing exercise, making coffee or any activity that will make your mind to stop thinking and focus on the physical activity.

When you get stuck on a problem you cannot solve our you feel demotivated to work take micro naps. A good way to do them is to grab something heavy and put your hand close the end of your bed so when you fall sleep the sound of the object will wake you up.
