title: Seeking Wisdom (Notes)
---

These are my notes from the book Seeking Wisdom from Peter Bevelin. I might sintetice more later but I'm pretty sure I won't. These notes are more for my use that for sharing and that might mean unexpected changes on writing styles or even maybe a spanish comment here and there.

Before I start, I want to quote Gian-Carlo Rota (this same quote is in the book, and it has been one of the best quotes I have read)

> The advice we give others is the advice we ourselves need. - Gian-Carlo Rota

## Introduction

This book seeks wisdom. It seeks a framework for better reasoning.

This book is about how our thoughts gets influenced, why we make misjudgements and tools to improve our thinking.

Is not only about how intelligent we might be. Is about what our thinking habits are.

Do not try to learn everything by yourself, is better to help you by reading good books. Is a waste of time to discover something that it has already discovered by someone else. Instead, use that knowledge to expand even your thinking even more.

## (Part One) What influences our thinking?

Our behaviour is influence by our anatomy, psychology, the environment and our culture.

As an example, depending on the cells our brain have is how we react to things. Experiments where brain cells from an animal where transplanted to another make that animal to behave like slightly like the owner of those brain cells.

Literally our brain anatomy can cause changes on our behaviour. We have to remember that our brain if not a big mesh of the same things. Instead, is an organ with different parts that are responsible for some of our behaviours. So if there is a change or damage in one of those parts then subsequently our behaviour will change.

Our anatomy (brain and body), psychology and biochemistry are the ones responsible for our behaviour.

The number of cell is less important than the number of connections between those cells. The more connections there are the more patterns our brain can reason with.

What we think and feel depends on chemical reactions and, those reactions are a function of how our neurons connect. (Does that mean that our brain can be seen as a feedback loop, where certain reactions that liberate chemicals enforce that our brain seek those chemicals?).

Different neurons react to different chemicals also different neurons release different chemicals when trigger.

> Question: Can we change our improve the links between our neurons?

Antidepressants do not make us happy; they treat the state of unhappiness.

Our genes, life experiences, situational or environmental conditions, randomness are what determines how these neurons connect and their patterns.

### (One) Our anatomy sets the limits for our behaviour

### (Two) Evolution selected the connections that produce useful behaviour for survival and reproduction

### (Three) Adaptive behaviour for survival and reproduction
